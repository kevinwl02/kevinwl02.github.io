On 2020 I created [AltSwiftUI](https://github.com/rakutentech/AltSwiftUI) to deal with a major shift in iOS development: the transition from UIKit to SwiftUI.

This is an open source UI framework built on top of UIKit and result builders. It has an almost identical interface to SwiftUI, and provides very similar functionality. This includes declarative UI, state management, automatic view updates, etc.

The main purpose of this framework is to help projects transition to SwiftUI with ease in the future. In enterprise environments, backward compatibility is a common necessity. So it also helped engineers hone their SwiftUI related skills much earlier.
